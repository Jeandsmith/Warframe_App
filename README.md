# Tenno Managament System

This will be a simple application to manage Tenno inventory,
and location in which components, and resources can be found.
Hopefully, with drop chance.

For more information on Warframes the games see: 
The [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/) page and

## The Swing API
For the main desktop application I will be using Java and
